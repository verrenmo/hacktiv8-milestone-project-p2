# Brief Explanation of NoSQL:
NoSQL (Not only SQL) is a database management system designed to handle semi-structured and unstructured data types.  
NoSQL is more flexible than RDBMS, does not require complex queries, is ideal for handling large volumes of data, allows for horizontal scaling, and does not require rigid schemas/relationships like RDBMS.

# When to Use NoSQL:
- Unstructured or semi-structured data types.
- Flexible or frequently changing data structure.
- High speed data requirements, such as in real-time applications.
- Large data size.
- Supports horizontal scaling.
- Commonly used in e-commerce or logistics applications.

# When to Use RDBMS:
- Structured data types.
- Data with clear and consistent relationships.
- Requires complex queries for data analysis.
- Supports vertical scaling.
- Suitable for data requiring consistency, such as banking or financial systems.

# 2 NoSQL Tools/Platforms Besides Elasticsearch and Their Advantages:
- MongoDB
  --- Document store type
  --- Supports storing documents in JSON or BSON format
  --- More flexible data structure
  --- Horizontal scaling
  --- Simple queries that are easy to understand and use

- Redis
  --- Key-Value Store type
  --- Stores data in memory, making it fast for real-time applications
  --- Supports various data types such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, making it very flexible
  --- Simple syntax and easy to integrate with various applications

# Explanation of Airflow:
- A platform for organizing, managing, scheduling, and monitoring workflows to ensure processes run smoothly.
- One of its uses is to execute ETL processes: extracting data from a source, transforming the data, and loading the data into a database or data warehouse.

# Explanation of Great Expectations:
- A tool that helps verify and test data quality against specific rules or conditions.
- If the condition is met, the data is considered valid and compliant with the established standards.

# Batch Processing:
- A data processing method that processes a set of data at a specific time.
- There are 2 types of batch processing: scheduled and periodic.
- In batch processing, data is first collected over a period and processed together at the designated time.
- A case example of batch processing is the payroll system, where companies calculate salaries, deduct taxes, and transfer employee salaries at the end of each month.
- Data processing for customer analysis reports is also an example of batch processing, where customer data is collected over a period and then used for monthly or annual report analysis.
- The stages and tools used in batch processing are:
  1. Storing data: Data is stored in Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
  2. ETL: Using Amazon Lambda or Google Cloud Function.
  3. Aggregated ETL Processing: Using Amazon EMR, Amazon Glue, and Google Cloud Dataproc.
  4. Data Warehouse: Using Google BigQuery.
